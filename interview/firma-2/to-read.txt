Plan rozmowy:

1) O sobie - poÄ‡wicz to co mamy po angielsku, Robot Framework znasz od 6miesiecy

2) Robot Framework - I've been using Robot framework for about 6months. I started using it because
we are doing a lot of Selenium tests in Python and I found out that Robot makes this tests much easier.
I've been using Selenium, Playwright and Robot and I think that Robot is the easiest one to write and has the easiest SYNTAX.

3) Performance testing - We are doing a little  bit of performance testing. We use DevTools and Performance Tab
to slow down the connection speed. We also run same test multiple times (100-200 at the same time) to see how they 
perform in scripts or write robot or selenium test that does soemthing 200 times 
- We've used DevTools -> lighthouse for basic performance metrics
- I've heard about JMeter but did not have time to use it

4) ISTQB - we use ISTQB best practices, we use it to create test documentation using REQ_TS_TC notation
and check coverage of requirements analysing report.html and xml

5) Azure Devops - I've heard about it, you can manage prints and pipelines in it. I haven't used it, we use 
Open Project for tasks management and Jenkins for CI/CD

6) For API testing we use POSTMAN and we test our REST api written in .NET and C#. Frontend is written in Angular

7) We use SCRUM (sAFE is used in bigger companiees, we are using a simplier form of Scrum)
- we have Planings every 2nd Monday 
- our Sprints last for 2 weeks
- we deliver on last friday of each sprint
- we use GIT and release branches to deliver to customers
	- main branch 
	- release/rel-03-01
	- release/rel-03-02
	
- we have Review (how did we do last sprint) and Retrospective (how was the team work) meetings on Wednesdays

8) Reporting:
	- we generate test reports using cobertura (google cobertura test coverage -> grafika) and I look at 
	generated reports to see the coverage
	- I check and report coverage on Review meetings
